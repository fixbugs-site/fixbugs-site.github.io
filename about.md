**FixBu.gs** is my blog, containing my research of software engineering, especially software maintainence, software analysis. In this blog, I also share my ideas in SE as well as some techniques in doing research.  `fixbu.gs` is just a domain hack, meaning "fix bugs".

Research of software engineering is more and more important. I believe that the achievement in this field can deeply affect the entire software life cycle, not only help programmers ***fix bugs***. Therefore, I setup this website.

My personal information is put in [my home page](https://timkong.net).
