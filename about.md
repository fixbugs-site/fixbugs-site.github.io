**FixBu.gs** is a website storing anything about my research of software engineering, especially software maintainence, software analysis. `fixbu.gs` is just a domain hack, meaning "fix bugs".

Research of software engineering is more and more important. I believe that the achievement in this field can deeply affect the entire software life cycle, not only help programmers ***fix more bugs***. Therefore I setup this website, sharing the newest papers in top-level conferences and journals, my ideas in software engineering and some techniques in doing research, etc. 

My home page is [https://tim-kong.github.io](https://tim-kong.github.io).
